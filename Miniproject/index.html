                A number of years ago I went on holiday to a beautiful part of Portugal. We stayed in a converted farmhouse in the middle of a national park. The farmhouse was in a valley. We arrived in the evening when the birds were just starting to roost. It was still warm and the air smelled.

                Car symbols come in many different forms, with three distinct categories leading the industry. Animals are a popular option, as they quickly evoke the strength, speed, or intelligence of a particular creature. Meanwhile, abstract symbols can inspire feelings of adventure, sophistication, and power with nothing more than a few lines. Maybe the most popular symbol type, the modified monogram uses a stylized version of your brand’s initials to recall a company’s full name. Whatever symbol type you select, make sure it matches your logo’s other elements, to create a car logo that runs like a well-oiled machine.
